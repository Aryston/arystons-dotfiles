# aryston's dotfiles

This repository contains my personal configuration files for various tools and environments. Feel free to use them or adapt them to your needs.

## Installation

The files in this repository are designed to be placed in your home directory.  You can either manually copy them or use a dotfiles manager like [Dotbot](https://github.com/anishathalye/dotbot) or [GNU Stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/).

### PowerShell Profile

To incorporate my PowerShell profile into your setup:

1. Open PowerShell as an administrator.
2. Type `notepad $profile` and press Enter. This will open your PowerShell profile in Notepad.
3. Copy and paste the contents of my `Microsoft.PowerShell_profile.ps1` file into your PowerShell profile.
4. Save the file and restart PowerShell for the changes to take effect.

## Included Configurations

* **PowerShell:**
    - My `Microsoft.PowerShell_profile.ps1` file contains a custom `uptime` function to display the uptime of your local and remote machines.  
    
Feel free to modify and extend these configurations to fit your own workflow and preferences.
